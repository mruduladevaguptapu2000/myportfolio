**About Me – Mrudula Devaguptapu**

I’m a passionate Big Data & ETL Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience designing and optimizing cloud-based data pipelines, transforming raw data into meaningful insights. My expertise lies in tools like PySpark, Hive, AWS EMR, and DataStage, and I’m skilled in building scalable ETL frameworks that support enterprise-level analytics. I also have strong working knowledge of SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and SSRS, helping business users make smarter decisions through data storytelling.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer and Information Sciences at Saint Louis University, I bring a strong foundation in computer science along with real-world experience from my time at Tata Consultancy Services, where I delivered impactful projects in data warehousing, automation, and dashboarding.

I’m also certified in Microsoft Azure (AZ-900) and as a Google Associate Cloud Engineer, and I stay curious about emerging technologies in cloud data ecosystems and machine learning. Beyond tech, I enjoy reading, traveling, and learning through hands-on projects.
